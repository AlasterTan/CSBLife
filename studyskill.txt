STUDIESSKILL
1.Have you ever failed an exam? what were the reasons for failing?
-Yes I have failed an exam because I did not study in the subject the I should be studying or the one I review did not show in the exam that why I failed, but the first one is the one I will never do again because life is different in college.

2.For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highest score? what made you reach the top?
-I cannot answer this question because I have already failed in an exam.Only very smart people can answer this question that is that they never failed any in their whole life.

3.How was your first experience of CSB midterm examinations? knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? what are you going to do again for the CSB finals?
-My first experience of the CSB midterm examinations is a bit happy and a sad way because I failed some of my subjects and passed some. I would have done differently by studying more and listen more to my teacher. I will still probably study for all of my subjects so that I could pass them all this time.
