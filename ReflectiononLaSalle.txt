"Yes I adore in all things the will of God in my regard"

In Saint Jean Baptist De La Salle's quote he said that he
 adore in all things the will of God in his regard, I think 
it is because that he himself believes that God created all 
this things we see, and that is true he adores all of it 
because it is all a gift from God, God the creator of man 
kind and everything we see now. I also think that he said 
that because God has an intended purpose for all things, 
events, family, friends, and more, also as God's child you 
must learn to accept these things and love and follow the 
will of God.
