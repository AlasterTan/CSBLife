New Routines
-My new routines in now is that I always go out to have fun and play, also I have no lunch box anymore because in college all of us are far from our house we also have to just buy our own food because if we have our lunch box we will have a hard time bringing the stuffs.

New Relationships
-My New relationships in college is my new block mates because my new classmates is the that I would be seeing when i'm going to school every time also they are the one that i'm going to be with for a long time so I should be close with them. They are my new relationships also because my old friends will also find their new relationships.

New Roles
-My new Roles in my life this year and next year is that I will study hard and not play around in my subjects because high school is different from college because in high school sometimes you could just play around and just study late because some of it is just easy to study, but in college it is really hard to play around and have fun a long time because in college it is really hard to study because the time management is really tight.

New Assumptions
- I am now a Benildean Lassalian so my assumptions in my life is that one day I would be a successful GDD because I myself want to be successful in my studies because it is important to be successful, it is for our future also it is the one that will make our lives a better place just by studying well and hard and that is my new assumptions.
